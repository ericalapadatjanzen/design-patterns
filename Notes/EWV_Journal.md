Encapsulate 
Restrict outside access to a things parts.  
Bundle that things state with the operates that use that state.   
What Varies 
This refers to changes in the code base not changing variable value.  
Reasons to change aka responsibilities aka axis of change include: 
Requirements 
Refactoring 
Performance improvements 
Business needs 
Understanding the problem space 
Motivation 
Deal well with future change in requirements.  
Requirements come from business needs or a change in understanding of the problem. 
By "restricting outside access" to the "parts of the code that will change", we can later change those parts without needing to change other parts of the system.   
Methodology 
Use interfaces to separate the stable interface from the unstable implementation.
