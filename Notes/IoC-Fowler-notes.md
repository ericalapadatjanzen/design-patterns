Inversion of Control 
Whose code is in control of when an application operation executes?  
Application code or framework code? 
Application code defines an operation 
…inserts it into the framework, and 
...the framework controls when to execute it.  
Libraries vs Frameworks 
Libraries tend to provide operations that applications can call.  
Frameworks tend to provide in-built behavior, into which applications insert operations. 
Inversion of Control Patterns 
Binding delegate to events 
Implementing interfaces 
Traps 
IoC containers use inversion of control techniques (such as dependency injection)
