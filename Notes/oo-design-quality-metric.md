Instability. I = (Ce ÷ (Ca + Ce)) 
Ca. The number of classes outside the category that depend on classes inside the category. 
Ce. The number of classes inside the category that depend on classes outside the category.

Abstractness. A = (number of abstract classes ÷ number of classes)

Distance from Main. D = |(A + I - 1)|

We want D to be near zero: stable categories are highly abstract; unstable categories are highly concrete.
