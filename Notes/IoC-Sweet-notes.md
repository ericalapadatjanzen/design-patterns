Generally speaks about the MESA programming environment.  
Glossary:  
Re-entrant: can be interrupted mid-execution and then safely called again before its previous invocations complete execution. Synonyms: pure procedure, sharable code. Related to but not the same as thread-safe.  
First-class values: can be passed as parameters and stored in data structures.  
Preempt: to do something in advance, often in order to prevent something from happening.

...rather than adopt an "ask the user for a command and execute it" model. 
I did not read beyond page 218.
